Project structure for a local build using npm and npx. Install the necessary tools as described here in ["Option 1"](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation).

Once set-up, build with ```npx vite``` and press `o` to open it in a browser. It will take around 5 seconds to load all assets.
