# Ukiyoe 3D

A 3D recreation of Utagawa Kuniyoshi's "The Spirit of Oiwa" (1848) using Three.js. All assets were modelled/drawn by me. The live demo can be found at https://avinella.github.io/ukiyoe-3d/.

The ```local-build``` branch contains instructions to build the demo locally using npm and npx.

Final project for UCLA's DESMA156
